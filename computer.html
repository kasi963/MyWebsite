    <h1>WHO IS KASI?</h1>
    Hello guys, and welcome to my website.

    Want to know about Kasi? Alright, here you go. <br>

Kasi is a very pretty 18 year old girl currently studying computer engineering at KNUST. <br>
Why she chose Computer Engineering?<br>
hmm... she wonders too. But, she loves to build machines, and code... probably, 
that is why she chose computer engineering. <br> Her favorite language to code in (the only language she can code in)
is C++. <br>
When she is not busy with school work, she sketches, plays lawn tennis or just chill around. <br>
Thats all you need to know guys... adios!
